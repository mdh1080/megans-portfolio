            <p>
                My name is Megan Hatfield. My background is in mental health counseling and office management. I am new to the IT field, but believe my ability to problem solve, think abstractly, and work collaboratively are a few of the skills that will help me to be an effective web developer. I completed a 6 month full-stack coding bootcamp in March 2023. Some of the projects I created both independently and with a group are below.
