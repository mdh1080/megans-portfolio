            <p>
                I'm a recent graduate of the full-stack coding bootcamp at UNCA. I'm eager to get started in a new career field so I can start using all the skills I acquired. My background is in mental health counseling and office management. My 20+ years of professional work experience have helped me to aquire the skills needed to be an effective web developer. Abstract thinking, attention to detail, and adaptability are a few of the qualities that will make me an effective web developer. My personable nature gives me the ability to work collaboratively and manage others. Some of the projects I created both independently and with a group are below.
